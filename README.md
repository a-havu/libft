The first project at Hive Helsinki:

Create your very own library of functions.
Many of the functions are recreations of existing C library funtions like atoi, memcpy, strdup etc.

I have updated my libft to "libft plus", which now includes both my get_next_line priject and ft_printf.
Handy to have around in other projects!
